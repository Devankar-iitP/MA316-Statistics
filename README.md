# MA316-Statistics
During the course of my academic journey, in the third year, I was privileged to undertake the MA316 course. This course served as a comprehensive introduction to the basics of statistics using R. It provided me with understanding of basic principles and methodologies employed in the field of stats.

It taught me one of the significant data handling languages, the R language. This language, renowned for its application in statistical computing and graphics, became a vital tool in my toolkit.
